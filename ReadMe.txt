About Project:
"Info-tend‚Äù is a machine learning based OCR (Optical Character Recognition) that utilizes computer vision to distinguish printed 
or handwritten text characters inside digital images of physical documents, such as a scanned paper document as primary feature 
and an attendance management system as our secondary goal. Our team is utilizing the latest technologies in Computer Vision and 
Deep Learning to efficiently use OCR for verification of text. The end users need to register themselves and provide the system 
with handwritten copy of text displayed by themselves as input, after the registration our machine learning model building using 
Convoluted Neural Networks (CNNs) will create a profile in which the user's handwriting style will be stored and will be used in 
the future.
